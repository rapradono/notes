## Introduction
Hi there! I am Acil, a PhD student at the [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/kr/), specifically with [Integrated Nanophotonics Lab](https://kaist-yu.notion.site/) in the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/). My research interests are in physics and photonics. 

I intend to make this website as my digital garden, in which it will includes my thoughts, notes, and links on the topics I care about (most of the time it will be related to my research). Everything is written in markdown with Obsidian, connected to the repo with obsidian-git plugin.  

You can find me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rapradono), [Mastodon](https://fediscience.org/@rapradono), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZXYD8hsAAAAJ&hl=en).
